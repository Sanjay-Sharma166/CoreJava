The festival of Rakhsha Bandhan is an Indian festival that is usually celebrated among
Hindu families. It is a symbol of the strong bond that is shared by brothers and their
sisters.
                  Apart from personal celebrations in houses, public celebrations also
take place in the form of fairs and community functions. The sisters begin to prepare
for the occasions a week before the actual festival. They gather in the bazaars and shop
for fancy and beautiful rakhis. A lot of girls prefer to make rakhis of their own. The
brothers also prepare for the festival, and they purchase gifts fortheir sisters â€“ sweets,
chocolates, and other gift items. The ritual strengthens the love and friendship shared
between the two people.
